  "p_1": "I wanted to test my ability to use shapes solely, meaning no text or lyrics in the video. Nearly everything in the video was vectored out, with the exception of paint splatters that were jpegs animated by scaling them over time. Some of the more complicated vectors were done in Illustrator, leaving the simpler vectors to be made in After Effects. The repeater function helped a lot in After Effects, allowing me to repeat vectors and symbols with ease to make systems more populated and complicated."
