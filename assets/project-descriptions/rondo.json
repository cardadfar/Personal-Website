  "p_3": "Aside for the more basic shapes such as ellipses and rectangles, I used vectored assets from Illustrator and animated their transformation properties. The entire animation was kept in 2D. To make scenes smoother, I parented graphics to a null object and used the null as a camera for the scene, such as in panning and zooming.",

  "p_5": "The repeater function helped a lot, allowing me to repeat vectors with ease to make systems more populated and complicated. I used the repeater's animation offset feature to delay the animation for successive repeated objects.",
  "p_6": "I used a paint splatter asset library for the paint splatter effect. The splatters came as jpegs, where I would animate the scale to make it look like they were just created."
