  "p_16": "Worm Park uses a simple algorithm to generate worm chains by drawing shapes at positions [x + t*cos(k), y + t*sin(k)] for k in [0, 2*pi] and connects each location with a line to [x,y], where this is the point most recently clicked clicked. As time t progresses, the worm chains will grow farther out and decrease in size before they disappear. Tweaking with the [UP] and [DOWN] keys will increase/decrease the magnitude of t such that chains will grow farther/shorter out. [LEFT] and [RIGHT] modify the size of the shapes being drawn.",
  "p_17": "In repeat [R]mode, for every 3-5 frames, the draw() function is automatically called, and worm chains will generate themselves depending on where your mouse is on the screen. Without repeat mode, a click to the screen will call the draw() function.",
  "p_18": "Build into Worm Park is a custom flocking algorithm that takes the current position of the mouse and pulls every worm particle towards it. Particles on a ring move at different speeds, with some being quick to move over, and others having more inertia."
