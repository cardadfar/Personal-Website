The tiles would cut off at a certain distance, so I only animated a potion of the grid-moving-forward cycle, making sure they start and end had the same grid pattern so that I could loop it.",

Using a repeater effect, I would repeat each particle vertically to replicate a line. This way, multi-colored line streaks would fall form the top bend towards the camera slightly at the point of the warp filter."
