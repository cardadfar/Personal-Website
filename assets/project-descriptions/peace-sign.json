  "p_8": "After importing the rendered references into Flash Professional, I created another layer with a white translucent solid and an additional layer above that where I would draw. The white solid prevented the original reference from showing too much so that I could see my own brush.",

  "s_13": "Typography Tracing.",
  "p_14": "I also used reference for the typography components. I dedicated a separate layer to text, where I would use size 70 Arial font. Just like the central animation, I animated the typography on 2s. For each segment of lyrics, I traced the text 3 times and looped it.",

  "p_15": "To get the text to write itself, I used the lasso tool to delete the text that was not yet said on a given keyframe. I sped this process up by editing multiple keyframes at a time. If I knew a word wasn't said until a certain keyframe, then for all the keyframes before it, I would edit them by using the lasso tool to select the word that hasn't been said and removing it from all previous keyframes.",
  
  "s_16": "Animation Composition.",
  "p_17": "Exporting the typography and animation as separate .swf files, I brought it into After Effects to touch it up. The biggest change was adding a color toner to change the colors of the strokes to a light blue. I did this by mapping the color black to cyan, and keeping other colors (like purple and yellow) consistent.",
  "p_18": "For the paper background, I used a large paper texture and broke it into 4 quadrants. Every 4 frames, the camera would relocate to a different quadrant. This would loop for the entire composition, giving the effect that the paper background is moving.",

  "d_19": "Dividing the paper background into quadrants",
  "p_19": "I overlayed the animation files over the paper texture. During the chorus, where there was both character and text animation, I highlighted the typography animation more by layering it in front and adding a near-transparent white feathered solid behind it.",

  "d_20": "Using a near-transparent white solid to highlight the typography",
  "p_21": "I kept the solid near-transparent so that it wouldn't interfere too much with the character animation, but would still make the typography recognizable without it blending in too much with the character animation."
