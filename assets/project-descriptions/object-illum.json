  "s_3": "Concept.",
  "p_4": "The algorithm takes as input an image sequence and breaks it down into global and local components using OpenCV. For each local component, it samples a discrete uniform grid-like region of points for illumination values across all frames. When proceeding to relight the image, it analyzes the average illumination of the object and uses bilinear interpolation to create a relight mask for the object for each frame.",
  "i_5": "object-illum/local-relight.png",
  "d_6": "Captures discrete illumination points on each local object. Uses bilinear interpolation to computer relight mask.",
  "p_7": "For global illumination, the algorithm partitions the hues of the first image using k-means into k discrete hue ranges and calculates illumination differences compared to the global illumination value of each hue bucket to compute the relight mask at each location.",
  "i_8": "object-illum/global-partitioning.png",
  "d_9": "Splitting a sequence of images into their hue buckets based on the hues of each pixel.",
  "p_10": "For each mask, the algorithm applies a 3x3 gaussian smoothening matrix to reduce harsh relighting edge artifacts. The mask is then taken and, given a relighting strength coefficient, pixels for each image are converted to HLS space, relight, and converted back to RGB space.",
